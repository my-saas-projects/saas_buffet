# BuffetFlow - Sistema de Gest√£o para Buffets

## Project Overview

BuffetFlow is a SaaS platform designed to simplify the management of buffets and event venues. The project is built with a modern web application architecture, clearly separating the backend from the frontend.

*   **Backend**: Developed with Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF) in Python. It is responsible for all business logic, data manipulation, and serving a RESTful API for the frontend.
*   **Frontend**: A Single-Page Application (SPA) developed with React and TypeScript. It is responsible for the user interface, navigation experience, and communication with the backend via API.
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL is the main database, managed by the Django ORM.
*   **Containerization**: The development and production environment is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Building and Running

### Backend (Django)

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

### Frontend (React)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Development Conventions

### API Conventions

The project follows the RESTful API conventions detailed in `docs/API_CONVENTIONS.md`.

*   **Endpoints**: Use plural nouns (e.g., `/api/events/`).
*   **Data Format**: JSON with `snake_case` for keys.
*   **Authentication**: Token-based authentication using the `Authorization` header.
*   **HTTP Methods**:
    *   `GET`: Retrieve resources.
    *   `POST`: Create a new resource.
    *   `PUT`/`PATCH`: Update a resource.
    *   `DELETE`: Remove a resource.

### Code Style

*   **Backend**: Follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
*   **Frontend**: Uses the ESLint configuration defined in `frontend/package.json`.

# AI Agents for Development

This directory contains a collection of specialized AI agents, each designed to assist in a specific role within the software development lifecycle of the BuffetFlow project.

## When to Use AI Agents

Use these agents to automate tasks, ensure compliance with project standards, and accelerate development. Each agent is pre-configured with the relevant context and guidelines for its area of expertise.

Invoke an agent when you need to:
- **Generate code** that follows backend or frontend guidelines.
- **Create new API endpoints** that comply with established conventions.
- **Get an overview** of the project status or plan new features.
- **Automate Git workflow**, such as creating branches or formatting commit messages.
